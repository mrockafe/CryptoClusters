# CryptoClusters
Using Scikit-learn machine model to find the best crypto value

## Overview
This project aims to group different cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their market data. We'll be using two powerful techniques: K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can do this using the following commands:


### pip install pandas scikit-learn hvplot


Step 1: Data Preparation
- We start by loading the cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file. This data includes information about various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. We also check for any missing or unusual values in the data.

Step 2: Data Normalization
- To ensure fair comparisons, we scale the data using a technique called StandardScaler. This makes sure that no one feature (like the price) has more influence on the clustering process.

Step 3: K-Means Clustering
- We use the K-Means algorithm to group cryptocurrencies with similar market behaviors. We'll find the optimal number of clusters, which is like asking how many different groups we want to create.

Step 4: Elbow Method
- We need to decide on the best number of clusters, and we use the "Elbow Method" to help with this. Think of it like fitting your clothes â€“ you want a balance between too loose and too tight. We're searching for that perfect balance.

Step 5: PCA Transformation
- Next, we'll use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This makes it easier to analyze and visualize. We'll find the total explained variance to see how much information we're preserving.

Step 6: Clustering with PCA Data
- Now, we apply K-Means again, but this time to the PCA-transformed data. We'll group the cryptocurrencies based on their PCA components, which help us understand their market trends.

Step 7: Visualize Clusters
- We create scatter plots to visualize the clustered cryptocurrencies. Each point on the plot represents a cryptocurrency, and its color indicates its cluster. This helps us see how different cryptocurrencies behave in the market.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, you'll have a better understanding of how cryptocurrencies can be grouped based on their market performance. Whether you're an investor or just a curious learner, this can provide valuable insights into the cryptocurrency world.
